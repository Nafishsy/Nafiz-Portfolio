👋 Hello there! My name is Nafiz,
I graduated recently with a Bachelor's degree in Computer Science and Engineering, specializing in Software Engineering from the American International University-Bangladesh (AIUB). 🎓 I am actively seeking fully funded PhD opportunities in the fields of Machine Learning and Deep Learning, with a strong focus on Image Processing. 🖥️🧠📷 Currently, I am expanding my knowledge in these areas to strengthen my candidacy for doctoral programs. 📚💡 My academic background and ongoing self-study have provided me with a solid foundation in these fields, and I am eager to contribute to cutting-edge research in image processing and related domains. 🚀🔬
