👋 Hello there! My name is Nafiz,
graduated recently with a Bachelor's degree in Computer Science and Engineering, majoring in Software Engineering from the AIUB. 🎓 I am trying to expand my knowledge in areas (Machine Learnig, Deep Learning, Computer Vision) to strengthen my candidacy for doctoral programs. 📚💡 My academic background and ongoing self-study have provided me with a solid foundation in these fields, and I am eager to contribute to cutting-edge research in image processing and related domains. 🚀🔬
