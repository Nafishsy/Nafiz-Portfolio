ðŸ‘‹ Hello there! My name is Nafiz,<br>
graduated recently with a Bachelor's degree in Computer Science and Engineering, majoring in Software Engineering from the AIUB. ðŸŽ“<br><br> 
I am trying to expand my knowledge in areas (Machine Learning, Deep Learning, Computer Vision) to strengthen my candidacy for doctoral programs. ðŸ“šðŸ’¡<br><br> 
My academic background and ongoing self-study have provided me with a solid foundation in these fields, and I am eager to contribute to cutting-edge research in image processing and related domains. ðŸš€ðŸ”¬
